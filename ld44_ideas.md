# Ideas
- Any kind of game where you spend your HP to buy things
- Your character's soul is sold by demons or something
- Tower defense where you spend the "target"'s HP to build things
- Mothership: Spend your mothership's health to spawn sub-ships
- Game where you play as the spirit of a forest who is trying to prevent it from being blighted by orcs. You must blight parts of the forest to use your abilities.
- Energy Freighter: You play as a merchant ship carrying energy. The energy is also used for your shield.
  - Use sort of JRPG-esque combat.
- Nanoship: Your health can be used for special abilities
- Shooter game where you fight robots. Collect parts to power yourself up (you're a robot, presumably?). Use robot parts to buy upgrades, but it's also your health.
  - Player is a robot with 2 guns
  - Left gun is rapid-fire bolt gun, right is missile launcher
  - 1 - Upgrade left weapon
  - 2 - Upgrade right weapon
  - 3 - Upgrade energy regeneration
  - 4 - Upgrade armor
  - 5 - Upgrade jumping
  - Enemies: Tank-like thing, some sort of melee bot
  - Names?
    - Robot Town (Obscure joke on my game in LD20)
  - WHat is the plot?
    - You're bringing in malfunctioning robots (isn't this basically the plot of Robo Recall?)
    - SOme kind of ROBOT WAR
    - Rogue robots have stolen some kind of ... thing ... you've got to get it back
